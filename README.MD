# Tailwind CSS Builder

## What?

A compiler where you send the Tailwind [configuration file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) and returns a
CSS ready to use

## Why?

Sometimes you need customization but don't want to setup all the packages.

it does not support any customizations. You can use this compiler to generate your CSS
